WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   A1/SPI_MODULE/spi_1/A1/word_counter_send[11]_PWR_10_o_Select_66_o is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

   A1/SPI_MODULE/spi_1/A1/word_counter_send[11]_GND_71_o_Select_86_o is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
